# Main

## Jaime Arboleda Castilla {#title}

### Data Scientist \| Mathematician \| Software Engineer

Born in 1985 in Algeciras (Province of Cádiz, Spain).

I love gaining and sharing insights from data, as well as using those insights to make better decisions. I am always passionate about learning new things and I am able to do it fast. I am interesting in research and open problems, keeping up with new approaches in Machine Learning. Lately I have been very interested in Bayesian modeling and causal inference, although I have mostly worked on predictive modeling. I like programming and contributing to the open source community. I am easy to work with and I have always maintained good relationships with all my coworkers.

:::

**Projects**

::: concise
- Custom (based on KNN) clustering algorithm that, using the information of purchases and sales of each corporation, predicts whether its declared sector of economic activity is accurate or not. It was programmed in Scala.
- Identification of statistical position and undervaluation of goods fraud in Customs declarations by modifying an existing algorithm provided by European Commission. 
- Classifier (using XGBoost) for predicting whenever a taxpayer is most likely to make a mistake when modifying some parts of its draft of Personal Income Tax Declaration. The goal was to provide a nudge message to those taxpayers in the event of modification, aiming at reducing filling errors.
